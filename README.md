The Colorman project
Watercolors for the Color Blind
December 2, 2022

I am mostly color-blind, and I love colors. This project is for anyone struggling to express themselves and are unsure of their color choices.

My eyes cannot tell the difference between reds and greens. Also, light tints and dark tints look the same. Light yellow looks like green to me. Dark blue looks black. Yet, I can see colors, and I love the colors I see. A sunset with shades of pink and yellow have an emotional impact that makes me cry.

I took Maureen Bartenâ€™s water color class in Winter 2020. We started each class with Maureen picking the colors I would use. I use the Koh-I-Noor Watercolor Wheel Stack Pack colors, cold press watercolor paper, and inexpensive paint brushes. I created Colorman as software to select a color and match it to one of the colors in the Koh-I-Noor pack. Colorman is at:
